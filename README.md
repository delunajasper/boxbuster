An MVC application created in Visual Studio 2015 with C# & multiple tables with CRUD functionalities. This movie rental enable admins to search for customers and movies. This web app has client-side validation, is architectured utilising ASP.NET Web API that get consumed by jQuery AJAX.
                       
I learnt the value of testing and using Entity Framework 6 code first workflow to build a model and to query/update data. I grasped the concept of building and testing RESTful services using .net web API and PostMan. I also reinforced my knowledge on how to implement client-side validation and JQuery plugins such as datatables, bootbox and toastr.</p>
                                
I would like to add security and the ability for admin to restrict CRUD operations. I also would like to track customers and rented movies and be able to send return date notification. Will also implement client-side ReactJS to browse/add favourite movies and filter by genre.
